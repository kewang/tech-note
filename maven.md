# Maven

## 什麼是Maven

At first glance Maven can appear to be many things, but in a nutshell Maven is an attempt to apply patterns to a project's build infrastructure in order to promote comprehension and productivity by providing a clear path in the use of best practices. Maven is essentially a project management and comprehension tool and as such provides a way to help with managing:

* Builds
* Documentation
* Reporting
* Dependencies
* SCMs
* Releases
* Distribution

You have walked through the process for setting up, building, testing, packaging, and installing a typical Maven project.
